# RescueReach App

RescueReach is a mobile application developed using Flutter to provide support and assistance to rape and sexual assault victims. The app aims to create a community around these victims, offering a safe space where they can seek help and connect with others who have had similar experiences. üì±ü§ù

## The Problem

According to the Gender Based Violence Recovery Centre, a shocking statistic reveals that one in three Kenyan females has experienced sexual violence before the age of 18. Additionally, between 39% and 47% of Kenyan women experience Gender Based Violence (GBV) in their lifetime. These numbers highlight the urgent need for effective solutions to address this issue.

Existing technologies have failed to provide a reliable way for app users to determine the safety of their surroundings. There is a lack of prompt information about potentially dangerous areas, leaving victims vulnerable to further harm.

## The Solution

RescueReach is designed to tackle the challenges faced by rape and sexual assault victims by providing a comprehensive support system. The app offers multiple features aimed at enhancing the safety and well-being of its users. üõ°Ô∏èüåü

### Safety Information and Alerts

RescueReach allows users to report incidents of assault or harassment, contributing to a database that helps identify areas flagged as high-risk zones. Through surveys and user complaints, the app gathers information to generate safety alerts for specific regions. This empowers users with real-time information about potential dangers and enables them to make informed decisions about their safety.

### Community Support

The app creates a community of support by connecting victims with others who have faced similar challenges. Users can join groups, participate in forums, and engage in discussions to share their experiences, seek advice, and provide support to one another. This sense of community plays a crucial role in empowering survivors and breaking the isolation that often accompanies such traumatic experiences.

### Access to Resources

RescueReach includes a feature that provides easy access to law enforcement agencies, therapy centers, and other support services. Users can connect with these resources directly through the app, ensuring swift assistance and guidance when needed. By facilitating access to professional help, RescueReach aims to aid in the healing and recovery process for survivors.
